<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.0.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.0.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>. We hope to release a Windows binary soon.
</p>

<p>
This release implements the flares API (see the 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/docs/distro/USAGE.html">usage
    document</a>), which allows running several
alternative scans and then picking up the one with the shortest solution.
It also adds the <tt>-l children-playing-ball</tt> and 
<tt>-l sentient-pearls</tt> presets that optimise on solution length (based on 
flares).

    post about this release to the fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a>
giving some of the motivation for the new major release digit (3.x.y instead
of 2.x.y).
