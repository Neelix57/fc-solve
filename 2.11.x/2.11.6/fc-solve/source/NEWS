From version 1.4.0 to 1.6.0
---------------------------

1. Freecell Solver now has a solution optimization scan. Check it out
by adding the "-opt" flag.

2. Many comments were added to the code, and you are welcome to go over
it and see if you understand everything that goes on there. If you don't,
contact me and I'll add some more comments.

3. Several speed optimizations were done in the internal hash, so I think
it should run at least a little faster.
