<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.22.0 was Released, Now Under the MIT/X11 License-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.22.0
is now available for 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">download 
    from the download page</a>. This release converts from Public Domain
"licensing" <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/public-domain.html">which 
    is problematic for source code</a> to the more explicit and less 
controversial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/X11 
    License</a>. (Some source files that had been originated by other parties 
are still under the public domain).
</p>

<p>
Also in this release is some fixes to the build system (in part thanks to
a contribution by Risko Gergely), including the ability to prepare a static
library. 
</p>

<p>
Happy solving, and enjoy April Fool's Day Tomorrow.
