* The following invocation crashes Freecell Solver:

---------------------
./fc-solve --method soft-dfs --st-name 'dfs' -nst \
    --method a-star --st-name 'befs' \
    --trim-max-stored-states 100 \
    --prelude '200@befs,100@dfs,1000@befs,500000@dfs' \
    -s -i -p -t -sam 1941.board
---------------------

since +--trim-max-stored-states+ is a rarely used feature we decided to
release Freecell Solver 3.4.0 with this bug present.

* The dbm_fc_solver and depth_dbm_fc_solver currently crash on some
32-bit machines (such as i386/i586/i686) due to trying to use the lower bits
of the pointers as flags for the AVL tree, and other fitting stuff into
pointers games.

* As a result of that, the test suite currently fails on 32-bit
architectures.
