From version 2.12.0 to 2.14.0
-----------------------------

1. Fixed the compilation with profiling information in Makefile.gnu (should be
of concern only to developers). 

2. Optimized move_stack_cards_to_different_stacks, yielding a substantial
speed increase.

3. Converted the identifiers from starting with freecell_solver_ to 
starting with fc_solve_ , which is shorter and saner.

freecell_solver_user_ is still used in the API in order to not break
compatibility.

4. Made sure the effect of the "--sequence-move unlimited" option is not
dependent on other options, so the sequence move will always be unlimited.
(Thanks to larrysan for reporting this bug).

5. Fixed run-tests.pl (and as a result also ctest -V and make test) to
run properly after a raw unpacking.

From version 1.4.0 to 1.6.0
---------------------------

1. Freecell Solver now has a solution optimization scan. Check it out
by adding the "-opt" flag.

2. Many comments were added to the code, and you are welcome to go over
it and see if you understand everything that goes on there. If you don't,
contact me and I'll add some more comments.

3. Several speed optimizations were done in the internal hash, so I think
it should run at least a little faster.
