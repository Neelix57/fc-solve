Benchmarking a Freecell Solver Release
--------------------------------------

Requirements: perl-5.8.x or above, CMake, gcc, bash and a working
pthreads-devel package.

1. Download the Freecell Solver .tar.bz2 archive from 
http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ .

2. Unpack and cd to the freecell-solver-* directory.

3. Run +./Tatzer -l tt+.

4. Type +make+ to build everything.

5. Run +bash scripts/time-threads-num.bash -s 2 $MAX_NUM_THREADS+ . 
+
The default for +$MAX_NUM_THREADS+ is 6, where 7 completely hogs my system. If 
you have many CPUs and/or cores and you are confident that raising it will 
not overload your system, you may try to raise it.
+
Running the benchmarking threads is better done when the computer is not 
loaded.

6. Wait.

7. Type "perl scripts/time-fcs.pl dump DUMPS/*" and copy-and-paste the results 
to the Freecell Solver developers with specifications of your computer that 
are as detailed as possible.

Getting the test suite up and running
-------------------------------------

These are instruction how to get the test suite up and running:

1. Install the dependencies: Subversion, CMake (2.6.3 or later only), make,
gcc, g\++, valgrind, perl5 (at least perl-5.8.9, perl-5.10.0 or above is
recommended),  
+
+
* On Debian: 
+
--------------------
apt-get install subversion cmake make gcc g++ valgrind perl
--------------------
+
* On Mandriva:
+
-------------------
urpmi subversion cmake make gcc g++ valgrind perl perl-devel
-------------------

2. Install the dependencies of the test suite:
+
* Download +local::lib+ from http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/
and follow the instructions to set it up.
+
* Restart bash (no need to restart the computer, just open a new terminal
window).
+
----------
export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1
perl -Mlocal::lib -MCPAN -e 'install Task::FreecellSolver::Testing'
----------

3. Install the development headers of 
libtap ( http://jc.ngo.org.uk/trac-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/LibTap ).
+
* On Mandriva:
+
    # urpmi libtap-devel
+
* On Debian:

	$ tar -xvf /home/shlomif/Desktop/tap-1.01.tar.gz 
	$ cd tap-1.01
	$ ./configure --prefix="$HOME/apps/libtap"
	$ make CFLAGS+=-UHAVE_LIBPTHREAD
	$ make install
	# For gcc finding tap.h in the includes
	$ echo 'export CPATH="$HOME/apps/libtap/include:$CPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
	# For CMake to find the TAP library.
	$ echo 'export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/apps/libtap:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
+

4. Check out the latest Freecell Solver sources:
+
-------------------
svn co https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/fc-solve/trunk/
-------------------

5. +$ cd trunk/fc-solve/source/+

6. Cnfigure the Freecell Solver build

	$ ./Tatzer

7. Build Freecell Solver:

	$ make

8. Test Freecell Solver:

	$ make test
