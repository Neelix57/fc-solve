* Add fcs_flip_top_card() to the things that are not done in FCS_FREECELL_ONLY.

* Change fc_solve_rand_alloc() away from malloc() into handling a pointer
to a rand_struct.

* Put the rest of the news (from http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ ) inside the
NEWS file.

* Try to convert the macro-mania in tests.h (sfs_check_state_begin() / 
sfs_check_state_end() ) to functions, and see if it actually makes it faster.

* Write automated tests for split_cmd_line.c . 

* Make sure that "rpmbuild -tb freecell-solver....tar.bz2" works.
Right now, it only works if the .tar.gz is present.

* Experiment with getting rid of pointer to functions in the hash comparison
functions. They may incur a large run-time overhead. (inspired by Linux
kernel patterns from LWN.net).

* s/may be/maybe/ in +README.win32.txt+ .

* Update the "long solutions" help screen of fc-solve with the new presets.

* Deal with the inability to "make package_source" inside an unpacked
.../freecell-solver-x.y.z/ directory.

* Make sure that we can build Freecell Solver inside a ./build directory
without relying on asciidoc.

* Abstract away the hash changes for the columns-vs-states hash.
** Create an enum for choosing which one.

* Investigate +pi-make-microsoft-freecell-board 254076 | fc-solve -l by+ -
it should be solvable.

* Convert the +char * []+ arrays in the fcs_cl.h etc. to 
+const char * []+ (arrays of constant strings). Its use is a relic of 
+char * argv[]+ being non-const and having them as constant will bring many
advantages.

* Check that AsciiDoc is not required for preparing an .rpm (using a
test script.)

* Handle the case where the instance->hard_threads are re-allocated and
the pointers from the soft_threads to them are not updated.

* Add a +-o+ option to fc-solve to output to a different file than stdout.

* Flares: make sure the empty/null plan generates a run-indef followed by
a checkpoint instead of just a run-indef.
** Correct the tests.

* Extract the common functionality out of both copies of the "initialise
new instance_item copies in +lib.c+ .
** Also the flares.

* Implement Gary Campbell's FCELL.COM's methodology of trying several
atomic scans in different instances (with bounded quotas) and picking the 
shortest solution out of them all. Slow, but will produce highly short 
solutions.
** Called Flares - we've started to implement them and should continue.
** See the Flares functional spec under ../docs

* Update fc-solve and friends to handle the "wrong-flares-plan" compilation
problem.

* Change "A*" in the code's comments to BeFS.

* Normalise the +_free()+ and +_finish()+ methods in regards to the previous
commits of the A* functionality.

* Implement Soft-DFS and Random-DFS as pointers to test functions, similar
to what was done in the BeFS/BFS scan. Currently there is this code there:

----------------
fc_solve_sfs_tests[tests_order_tests[
                        the_soft_dfs_info->test_index
                    ] & FCS_TEST_ORDER_NO_FLAGS_MASK]
----------------

* Convert some of the documentation to Perl-POD or DocBook.
** Converted to AsciiDoc, which can generate DocBook.

* Find a way to update the ChangeLog from the svn.
** Rejected per advice of http://producingoss.com/[Producing Open Source
Software]

* Convert the boolean values in the C code to a specialised boolean typedef
called +fcs_bool_t+, just so readers can tell they are booleans instead of
ints.

* Deal with the fact that:
+./freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve 1 100 1 -mi 1+ displays 
"Unsolved Board" instead of "Intractable Board".

* Add a quick way to get rid of --fc-only from +./Tatzer -l p4b+ / 
+./Tatzer -l x64b+ .

* Add compact allocation for the Breadth-first-search (BrFS/BFS) queue
items.
** With recycling.

* Adapt more fcs_collectible_state_t * storage backends for FCS_RCS_STATES.
(libavl2 comes to mind.)

* Write a program to summarise an fc-solve invocation, giving the verdict,
validity, number of moves in the solution, number of iterations, and stored
states. It should be a wrapper for the fc-solve command line.
    - done: +scripts/summarize-fc-solve+ .
    
* Restore the old -mss flag behaviour and create a new trim-max-stored-states
flag where the new behaviour happens. max_stored_states should always increase,
and trim_max_stored_states should decrease if states were removed.
