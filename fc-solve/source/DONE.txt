* Add fcs_flip_top_card() to the things that are not done in FCS_FREECELL_ONLY.

* Change fc_solve_rand_alloc() away from malloc() into handling a pointer
to a rand_struct.

* Put the rest of the news (from http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ ) inside the
NEWS file.

* Try to convert the macro-mania in tests.h (sfs_check_state_begin() / 
sfs_check_state_end() ) to functions, and see if it actually makes it faster.
