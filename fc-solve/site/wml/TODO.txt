* "Input Freecell layout" should be "Input a Freecell layout".

* The "Populate with Numbered Deal" should be changed into an <input />-box
where one can type a number with a nice label.

* Change the font inside the tabs from the really bold thing into something
more aesthetic.

* write a better documentation of the format with examples.

* To be considered:
    - some sample layouts / example layouts example.

* Revamp the paragraph after the "About" - larger fonts and less technicalities,
and briefer text.

* Write a header for the UI before the tabs.

* Make the input textarea less wide.

* Handle invalid boards by telling which card is missing/extra.
