* The "Populate with Numbered Deal" should be changed into an <input />-box
where one can type a number with a nice label.

* "Input Freecell layout" should be "Input a Freecell layout".

* Change the font inside the tabs from the really bold thing into something
more aesthetic.

* Revamp the paragraph after the "About" - larger fonts and less technicalities,
and briefer text.

* Write a header for the UI before the tabs.

* Make the input textarea less wide.
