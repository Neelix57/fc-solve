<latemp_subject "Freecell Solver Book" />

<p>
Back before 2006, I was planning to write a book titled
<i>Freecell Solver - Evolution of a C Program</i>, but I didn't get too far,
and the book is now <b>out-of-date</b>, <b>unmaintained</b> and
<b>incomplete</b>.
</p>

<p>
I have placed the latest copy I worked on at
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/fc-solve/src/c06f2a63f100f6472e40eb8f63219ccb38dc024d/fc-solve/docs/Freecell-Solver--Evolution-of-a-C-Program/?at=master">the <code>fc-solve/docs/Freecell-Solver--Evolution-of-a-C-Program</code>
sub-directory</a> of the version control repository. You may wish to look into
it, but please <b>donâ€™t contact me</b> about it.

<h2>Recent Note (13-June-2006)</h2>
I have stopped working on the book after only finishing a few chapters, and
do not plan on resuming working on it in the near future. If you are interested
in learning more about Freecell Solver see the <a href="./docs/">documentation
page</a>.

<p>
I am writing a book titled that would cover the development of Freecell Solver, and various lessons
I learned by working on it.
