<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.20.0 was Released: Major Simple Simon Optimisations-->

<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.20.0,
has been released. Freecell Solver 3.20.0 is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
The highlights of this version are some major optimisations to the solving
code of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Simon_%28solitaire%29">Simple
Simon</a>, as well as many code cleanups, refactorings and smaller
optimisations. Furthermore, the “qualified-seed-improved” preset was added,
which yields shorter solutions.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
