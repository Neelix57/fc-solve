<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.24.0 Release: Mourning Adrian Ettlinger-->

<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.24.0,
has been released. Freecell Solver 3.24.0 is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
This release is dedicated to the memory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ettlinger">Adrian Ettlinger</a>
who passed away on
23 October 2013, who was a good Internet friend of the primary maintainer of
Freecell Solver (= Shlomi Fish), and who contributed a great deal to Freecell
Solver and to Freecell research and programming in general (among other major
life achievements, and contributions to man kind). You can read
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/conversations/messages/1379">an obituary of Mr. Ettlinger by Shlomi Fish</a> as it was
posted to the Freecell Solver Discussions mailing list, and also read
an
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/interviews/adrian-ettlinger.html">an
interview that Fish conducted with him</a> back in 2003.
</p>

<p>
The new <code>video-editing</code> preset was named in honor of Ettlinger’s
previous work in pioneering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_editing_system">non-linear video editing</a> back when he worked as
an Electrical Engineer (and later as a software developer) for
CBS corporation.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
In any case, the main highlights of this release are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<b>New Feature:</b> the <code>-l video-editing</code> (or <code>-l ve</code>
for short) flare-based preset that tends to yield shorter solutions on average.
See <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/conversations/messages/1378">a post</a> with some performance analysis.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A bug was fixed when providing input without a trailing newline character
(“\n”). This was reported against the online JavaScript version was Olaf and
was fixed globally. Thanks, Olaf!
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The distribution now contains the sources for the Split FCC (= Fully
Connected Component) Solver which was an unsuccessful attempt to
solve Windows Freecell deal No. 384,243 with two freecells. It may prove
of general utility in the future, though.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Hope you enjoy this release and we extend our sadness to the other family
members and friends of the late Mr. Ettlinger.
