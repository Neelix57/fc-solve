<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.24.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.24.0
was released today. It is available in a source archive from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Windows command-line binaries should be available
momentarily.
</p>

<p>
This version contains some fixes to crashes and memory leaks when
using the <tt>-opt</tt> with a range
of boards (or otherwise when a solver instance is recycled), a new
"freecell-solver-fc-pro-range-solve" executable (built by default,
but not installed), which runs a range of
deals using the solver and outputs the number of FCS moves, the number of
FC-Pro moves, and the FC-Pro moves in standard notation.
</p>

<p>
For developers, this release also contains a build type for profiling,
many cleanups to the code, and a makefile to generate
<a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> bitcode.
