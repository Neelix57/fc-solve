<!-- TITLE=Two Freecell Solvability Report for the First 400,000 Deals-->

<p>
With some help from some people on <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">the fc-solve-discuss list</a> and off the list (namely
Amadiro from <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/">the University of
Oslo</a> and someone else that I met on IRC
, I ran my solvers on the first 400,000 Windows Freecell deals
with only two available freecells to see how many of them can be solved.
</p>

<p>
Here is the report:

So about 79.47% of the deals can be solved and the rest are impossible. The
only intractable deal that none of my solvers could yield a verdict for is
No. 384,243, and it spans a very large number of states:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The dbm_fc_solver got into <q>Reached 12,821,000,000 ;
States-in-collection: 13,620,999,440</q>
before it failed to produce more results due to a limitation of the
hardware where it was deployed on.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The depth_dbm_fc_solver yielded this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Reached 13,763,700,000 ; States-in-collection: 16,226,294,490 ; Time: 1345126456.520408
Queue Stats: inserted=16,226,294,490 items_in_queue=2,462,594,490 extracted=13,763,700,000
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
with a curr_depth of 38. However, that solver may have some yet undiscovered
bugs.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
So what's next? Iâ€™d like to investigate some ways to scale to a larger
number of states, perhaps by creating a distributed solver. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=distributed%20breadth%20first%20search">Google search for distributed breadth
first search</a> yields some results:
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy the statistics for the time being.
