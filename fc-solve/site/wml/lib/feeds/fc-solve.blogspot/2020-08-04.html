<!-- TITLE=New Freecell Solver version: 6.0.1-->
<p>
<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>
is an open source library
and some command line applications, for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
There is a new release of the solver, version 6.0.1
with more details available in <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/distro/NEWS.html">NEWS file</a>.
Note that this version does not break compatibility with the older releases,
and we just felt like incrementing the primary digit.
</p>

<p>
Among the highlights are some code cleanups, some fixes, and some new features.
Special thanks go to <a href="https://github.com/antonio-rojas">Antonio Rojas</a>
for reporting a build issue in v6.0.0, which prompted a fix.
</p>

<p>
Share and enjoy!
