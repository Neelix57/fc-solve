<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.2.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.2.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>. We hope to release a Windows binary soon.
</p>

<p>
This release implements the <tt>--depth-tests-order</tt> flag that allows
varying the tests' order based on the depth which allows for interesting
(and faster) searches. Several new presets : <tt>-l the-iglu-cabal</tt>
, <tt>-l foss-nessy</tt> and <tt>-l tea-for-two</tt> have been added
, the latter optimised for two freecell deals. There are also several
bug-fixes, optimisations and code cleanups.
