<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.16.0 was Released + New Screencast-->

<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.16.0,
has been released. Freecell Solver 3.16.0 is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
This new release took about a month to prepare, and also contains less
profound changes than the previous release, but still quite a lot to look
for. It features the <tt>-l micro-finance-improved</tt> and
<tt>-l qualified-seed</tt> presets, which improve upon the average
solution length (at the expense of speed). The
<tt>--flares-choice</tt> flag was added and one can specify
<tt>--flares-choice fcpro</tt> to choose based on the length of the
Freecell Pro moves. Another additional flag is
<tt>--flares-iters-factor</tt> which multiplies the time the flares run at
by a factor for a speed/solution-length trade-off.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the individual flares are now recycled and their memory is
reused when they are no longer needed which yields a RAM optimisation
in certain cases.
</p>

<p>
More information about all these can be found in the
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/#distributed-docs">distributed
    documents</a> of Freecell Solver.
</p>

<p>
In addition to all that,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYdqNuX4WJc">a new screencast
    of PySolFC solving Freecell using Freecell Solver</a> is now available on
YouTube. Make sure you expand the details for all the credits of the software
and other material that was used for its creation.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy and happy holidays.
