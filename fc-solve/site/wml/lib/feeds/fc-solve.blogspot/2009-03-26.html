<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.20.0 was Released, along with a Windows Installer-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.20.0
is now available for
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">download
from the download page</a>. The big news is that executables for Microsoft
Windows (x86) are now available for it, for the first time since the early
2.8.x releases. And this time, they come in the form of an interactive
"Next→Next→Finish" installer based on
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
(NSIS)</a>.

Also in this release are a fix to a crash when using the range solver with
the "-opt" flag (and other similar scenarios), a more comprehensive NEWS file
and some other fixes.
