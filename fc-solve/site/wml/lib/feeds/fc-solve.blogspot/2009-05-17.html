<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.26.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.28.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the 
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This version contains several significant optimisations. Now the 
"freecell-only" preset can solve the first 32,000 Microsoft Freecell 
deals at 286 deals per second with gcc, and 301 deals per seconds with
<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers/">Intel's icc.</a>
(on a Pentium 4 2.4GHz computer). There are many other internal cleanups, 
build system tweaks, and new makefiles to build using some alternative C compilers.
</p>

<p>
The source archives from now on will be distributed as tar.bz2 instead of
tar.gz which gives better compression, and a faster download.
