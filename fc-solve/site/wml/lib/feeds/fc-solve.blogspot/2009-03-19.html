<!-- TITLE=Welcome to the fc-solve Blog-->
<p>
Welcome to fc-solve.blogspot.com. This will serve as the future blog and news-feed for <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> and related news, like general Freecell research, automated solving of other Card solitaire variants, and solving or playing other puzzles, riddles and games.
</p>
<p>
Freecell Solver started from a program I wrote (first in Perl and then re-implemented in ANSI C) to see if some ideas I had for solving Freecell would work. It performed well enough that I created a web page for it on my Technion's homesite, named it "Freecell Solver" and announced it on <a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a>. Since then, due to the constant feedback I received from people who tried to use it, it was greatly enhanced and expanded.
</p>
<p>
One of the things I invested the most time in was the online resources for support and information. The <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">web-site</a> started from one page, and then had two pages, and now has at least ten different pages, all with a different purpose. I also started <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">a mailing list at YahooGroups</a> to discuss the program and related programs, and it proved to be very active and lively.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that I set up were release-news that were present on the front page of the site and the <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/old-news.html">old news page</a>. A few days ago, I thought to myself: "If I'm maintaining these news items, why not create a web feed out of them?" And if we're going to have a web-feed - why not have a blog, with comments and the whole enchilada?
</p>
<p>
So this is the next step in communicating about Freecell Solver and related matters - a weblog. It's also my excuse to play with Blogger.com, and see how it fares in comparison to other web-journal services I know. (Like my friend once said "You gotta move or you stone.").

<p>
So if you've got something to say, say it here in a comment. And remember: if you're not in it for fun - I'm out of here!
