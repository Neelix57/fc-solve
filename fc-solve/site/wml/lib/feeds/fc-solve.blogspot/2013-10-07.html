<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.22.0 was Released: Bug Fixes-->

<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.22.0,
has been released. Freecell Solver 3.22.0 is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
The highlights of this version are some bug fixes: the Win32 NSIS (= Nullsoft
Installer) package should now build, run and process the presets (e.g:
<code>-l as</code> properly). Furthermore, there's a bug fix to the command line
flags processing, where flags whose prefixes are known flags were erroneously
recognised as such (e.g: <code>--resetjunk</code> vs. <code>--reset</code>).
</p>

<p>
On the new features side, the
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/">JavaScript-based solver</a>
now accepts arbitrary fc-solve command line options, so it can be used to
solve any of the supported variants of Solitaire, as well as support most other
fc-solve features.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
