<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.32.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.32.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This version features a large code cleanup which also resulted in a
substantial speed boost. The code cleanup was guided by
<a href="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/source/scripts/find-ids.rb?view=log">a
    script</a> that was written to list all occurences of identifiers with
the same name, in order to find uncommon identifiers.
</p>

<p>
There were several bug-fixes done to the
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>-based build system, and there's
now suppot for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/">Google's
    tcmalloc</a> and hidden internal identifiers in the DLL/shared-library.
The inline keyword for defining inline functions is now supported
on more compilers and more functions or macros have been converted
to inline functions.
</p>

<p>
We hope you enjoy this release.
