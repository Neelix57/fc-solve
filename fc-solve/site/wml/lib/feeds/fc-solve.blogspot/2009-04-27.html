<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.26.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.26.0
has been released  It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the 
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This version contains several significant optimisations (up to the point where
the "freecell-only" preset can solve the first 32,000 Microsoft Freecell 
deals in 200 deals per second.), and improvements to the build system 
(including the elimination of compiler warnings). Finally, the test suite
now builds correctly inside the source distribution.
</p>

<p>
We have more ideas for optimisations and other enhancements, and this is just
an intermediate release (but one which should be perfectly usable).
