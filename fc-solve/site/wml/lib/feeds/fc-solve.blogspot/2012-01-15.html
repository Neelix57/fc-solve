<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 3.10.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.10.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This release fixes two bugs - one with the <tt>--max-iters</tt> affecting
only the last instance, and one with reading foundations with <tt>0</tt>,
and implements many small optimisations and cleanups. It also adds some
experimental code with the so-called <tt>delta-states</tt>, where states
are compactly encoded based on the original state. This functionality is not
available in the main solver yet, but it powers the experimental
on-disk-key/value-databases-based solver, which end up not scaling very well
during testing.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
