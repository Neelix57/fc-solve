This release is dedicated to the memory of <b>Christina Grimmie</b>
( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Wikipedia Page</a> ;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zeldaxlove64">YouTube account</a> ), a
musician and singer whom I was
fond of and who was killed on 10 June 2016. The name of the new scan
“one-big-family” was inspired by the name of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNq1bkrWjbk">this video of hers</a>.
Some others of my favourite videos by Grimmie:

The new release features the new scan, fixes several bugs,
and incorporates many code cleanups, refactorings and optimisations. More
information can be found in the <a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/distro/NEWS.html">NEWS.txt / NEWS.html</a>. It also
adds the transpose-freecell-board.py program (thanks to Manish for the idea)
and removes some old board generation programs that are no longer relevant.
