Taking this into consideration, the Freecell solver may not be applicable to <a
href="http://www.pokerstars.com/de/">online poker</a> influenced games or
anything of similar description.

<p>
The current integration still leaves a lot to be desired. I haven't yet
enabled the use of Freecell Solver for Der Katzenschwanz and Die Schlange
, as well as all the pseudo-Freecell games like Cruel, Good Measure,
or Streets and Alleys. The latter may require translating moves
to single-card moves, as Freecell Solver may move the cards one sequence at
a time. <linkstar_ad /> Plus, Simple Simon cannot work because Freecell Solver
also moves non-homogenous sequences as one, so it was not enabled at the
moment.
