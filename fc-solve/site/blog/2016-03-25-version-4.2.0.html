<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 4.2.0,
has been released. It is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source library
and some command line applications, for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
This release sports the new configuration theme “-l conspiracy-theory”
(or “-l ct”) which is somewhat faster than the best contender up to it,
“-l amateur-star”, some relatively minor bug fixes, new compile-time
options, and many small and somewhat larger code cleanups, refactorings, and
optimisations.
</p>

<p>
“conspiracy-theory” is a reference to the Jewish holiday of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim">Purim</a>, which took place
around the time of its release and an
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/62243.html">old post</a> of mine
about it.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
