<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.34.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Back in the abandoned 2.10.x branch a programmer called Michael Mann
contributed a new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Simon_%28solitaire%29">Simple
    Simon</a> move function that allowed it to solve more games. In 2.34.0
this move function was restored, and made optional. We now have a theme
called "the-last-mohican" (or "tlm" for short), after the movie
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_%281992_film%29">"The
    Last of the Mohicans"</a> by a different Michael Mann, which I have watched
and enjoyed, that is capable of
<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/fc-solve-discuss/conversations/topics/1008">solving
    over 90% of the first 5,000 PySol Simple Simon deals</a>. (Incidentally
"The Last Mohican" is the direct translation of the book and movie's name
in Hebrew). The solutions of the solver were verified to be correct using
Games-Solitaire-Verify.
</p>

<p>
Working on this theme uncovered a bug in the solver where the
<tt>--next-instance</tt> flag was removed by accident, and it is now fixed.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, there's now an improved atomic moves theme -
"toons-for-twenty-somethings", which can solve all of MS Freecell's
32,000 deals. It is still much slower than the meta-moves-based theme.
</p>

<p>
There are also some other more minor changes, which can be found at the NEWS
file in the distribution.
