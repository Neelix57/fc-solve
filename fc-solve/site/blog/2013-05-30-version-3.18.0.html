<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.18.0,
has been released. Freecell Solver 3.18.0 is available in
the form of a source archive, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.

<p>
The highlights of this version are the new
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/">port</a> to
JavaScript, courtesy of the wonderful
<a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">emscripten compiler</a>
from LLVM to JavaScript, that allows Freecell Solver to run inside modern
browsers, as well as the fact that the test suite and the relevant now work
on 32-bit systems (previously they only worked on 64-bit ones).

<p>
Enjoy!
