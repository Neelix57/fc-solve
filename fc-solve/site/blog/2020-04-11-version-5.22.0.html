<a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>
is an open source library
and some command line applications, for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
There is a new release of the solver (version 5.22.0)
with more details available in <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/distro/NEWS.html">NEWS file</a>.
Among the highlights are cleanups, fixes, and some new features.

<p>
In addition, we are proud to announce that our attempt at classifying as many
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/freecell-pro-0fc-deals">zero freecells' deals</a>
as possible, as winnable or impossible to solve, has recently gone below
300,000 remaining unknown / intractable deals.
