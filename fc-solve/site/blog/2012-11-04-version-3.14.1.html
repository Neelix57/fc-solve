<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.14.0,
shortly followed by Freecell Solver 3.14.1, which fixed a build problem on
Microsoft Windows, have been released. Freecell Solver 3.14.1 is available in
the form of a source archive, and a Win32 self-installing executable, from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
This release features several new features: we added a 6th Best-First-Search
weight of the inverse of the number of cards not above parents, which has
proven useful. We now also allow test groups inside the <tt>--tests-order</tt>
and <tt>--depth-tests-order</tt> with the <tt>random-dfs</tt> scan to be
ordered using the function <tt>=asw(â€¦)</tt> based on those BeFS weights.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the preset <tt>-l amateur-star</tt> or <tt>-l as</tt> for short
has been added, that uses that and is our fastest preset yet. Another new
preset is <tt>-l micro-finance</tt> (or <tt>-l mf</tt> for short), which
yields especially short solutions.
</p>

<p>
There are also some not-as-major features: input boards can now contain a
leading
colon (":") at the beginning of the line of columns, so they can be
copy-and-pasted directly from the output of fc-solve with the <tt>-p</tt>
flag. The <tt>dbm_fc_solver</tt> and <tt>depth_dbm_fc_solver</tt> now store
the positions more compactly (which aided in researching two-freecell deals),
and the core libfreecell-solver code was made more 64-bit enabled and many
of the limits were converted to 64-bit friendly ones.
</p>

<p>
A final note: we have dropped support for building Freecell Solver with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B">Microsoft Visual C++</a>
and other non-GCC compatible compilers, which do not support the newer
C standards, and other useful features of GCC. Building Freecell Solver with
GCC, clang and other compatible compilers will be continued to be supported
on Microsoft Windows as well as on Linux and other UNIX-like systems.

<p>
More information about all these can be found in the

    documents</a> of Freecell Solver.

Enjoy!
