Yesterday, I spent some time on preparing
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHQ2bWGeYMg">a screencast of
    PySolFC auto-solving a deal of Freecell</a> using
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> . Here's an embedded
player:

I remember the first time I saw KDE's KPatience automatically solving a deal
of Freecell, while using Freecell Solver as its back-end. Seeing the cards
move on their own was very cool, and brought me a lot of joy.
Now that <a href="http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/">PySolFC</a> has built-in
support for Freecell Solver, I was able to use it to prepare the screencast.
I hope you'll enjoy seeing this screencast, and would be interested in
trying out PySolFC and Freecell Solver.

I'm going to blog about how I prepared the screencast on
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/">my tech blog</a>,
which may prove instructive to other people wanting to prepare screencasts
on Linux. This was the first video I ever prepared and producing it proved
to be a pleasant experience, even though some tasks did not work right away.
