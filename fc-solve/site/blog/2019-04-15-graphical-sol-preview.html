<p>
We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/js-fc-solve/text/">online web-based Freecell solver</a> now
has a graphical and animated solution display, thanks to the open source
version of <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Solitairey/branches">Solitairey</a>.
The older text-based solution display is still available.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>
is an open source library
and some command line applications, for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
Also of note is the new releases of the solver (up to version 5.6.0)
with more details available in <a href="https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/distro/NEWS.html">NEWS file</a>,
and some progress in <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/master/fc-solve/docs/debondt-compact-freecell-positions--document.asciidoc">compactly
storing Freecell positions/states</a>, going
below the 64-bits threshold.
