<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.12.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source archive from
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html">the
    download page</a>. Freecell Solver is an open source framework (library
and some command line applications), for automatically solving several
variants of card Solitaire / Patience games, including Freecell.
</p>

<p>
The first item to note is that the URL of its site changed from under
*.berlios.de to
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/</a>,
and that there is a redirect in place. Moreover, we have switched the version
control system from one based on Subversion to a git repository which is 
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve">currently hosted on GitHub</a>
(though we may move it later).
</p>

<p>
This release adds a new flag - <tt>--show-exceeded-limits</tt> or
<tt>-sel</tt> for short, that removes some ambiguity in the output,
and fixes a problem with starting the solver with <tt>--set-pruning r:tf</tt>
in conjunction with <tt>-opt</tt>. A new preset - <tt>-l three-eighty</tt>
(or <tt>-l te</tt> for short) has been added, which provides somewhat better 
performance.
</p>

<p>
The experimental <tt>dbm_fc_solver</tt> is now less experimental and can now 
store the positions inside binary trees in memory, and its memory consumption
has been greatly reduced since earlier versions. We also added another 
experimental solver called <tt>fcc_fc_solver</tt> which aims to determine
the solvability of a deal by analysing fully-connected-components (“FCCs”).
</p>

<p>
We also added support for building and testing the distribution in an
out-of-tree build, and there are some cleanups to the code.
</p>

<p>
More information about all these can be found in the
<a href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/docs/#distributed-docs">distributed
    documents</a> of Freecell Solver.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
