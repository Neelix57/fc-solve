Subject: Perl QOTW #2010-02-22 - Freecell Scans with Short Solutions

IMPORTANT: Please do not post solutions, hints, or other spoilers
until at least 60 hours after the date of this message.  Thanks. Requests
for clarifications and other discussion would be OK.

---------------

Today I'm borrowing the collective wisdom of the Perl Quiz-of-the-Whatever
forum for an alogrithmic task I need to accomplish for my own project - 
Freecell Solver - http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ , which is an automated solver 
for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell and several other types of card 
Solitaire. 

fc-solve starts from the initial layout of the Solitaire game, and recurses
into more and more positions (which are counted by the solver's iterations) 
until it reaches the final state where all cards were moved to the
foundations. Then it after certain number of 
iterations (which are roughly indicative of how long it takes it to run), it
yields a solution of a certain length (which is desired to be as short as
possible). 

Now, fc-solve has several different atomic scans, that when run alone, each
yields different solutions with different iteration counts and lengths.

In this Subversion directory, I have collected the iterations counts and the
solutions lengths of a sample of boards - the first 32,000 games in Microsoft
Windows FreeCell:

http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/presets/soft-threads/meta-moves/auto-gen/

(short URL - http://xrl.us/bgwj3o ; there's also an https:// equivalent, which
may work better, but it's a self-signed certificate).

After installing the dependencies - PDL (= the Perl Data Language) , 
Class::XSAccessor and Exception::Class (and maybe some others) you can query 
it by using the script query.pl like that:

<<<
shlomi[fcs]:$presets$ scan="1"
shlomi[fcs]:$presets$ board_idx="120"
shlomi[fcs]:$presets$ perl query.pl -l "$scan" "$board_idx"
123
128
>>>

Though you probably would like to inspect the query.pl source code and
see how you can access the data directly using PDL, and convert it to a 
different format.
