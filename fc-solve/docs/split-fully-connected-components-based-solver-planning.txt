Specification for a split solver basd on FCCs (= Fully connected components):
===========================================================================

First of all see the file fully-connected-components-based-solver-planning.txt
in this directory, for more information about the fully connected components
analysis based on non-reversible moves.

The purpose of this solver is to run several processes and be able to process
individual FCCs, output the results to an intermediate file, which will then
be integrated into the starting points for the next depth of FCCs.

Representation of an FCC fingerprint:
-------------------------------------

An FCC Fingerprint consists of roughly 52 (for each of the cards), states
of { ORIG_POS = 0, ABOVE_PARENT_CARD_OR_EMPTY_SPACE = 1, IN_FOUNDATIONS = 2 }
which together shows which non-reversible moves led to the FCC. The
fingerprint aims to segment several distinct FCCs into FCC-groups so they
can be processed separately. It is possible that several different FCCs will
belong to the same fingerprint, but this will be handled.

In any case, the fingerprint will be identified by a binary vector of those
52 ternary digits, and the next fingerprints of a derived state will be
calculated from the original based on non-reversable move.
