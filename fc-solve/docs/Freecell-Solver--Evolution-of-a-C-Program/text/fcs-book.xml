        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para> <!-- para, nidfoq eth kol ha'eder. ;-) -->
            One day in the spring break between two semesters I went out 
            running<footnote id="running">
                <para>
                    &fcs; is not the only good idea I got while going out to 
                    run. Another one is "The One with the Fountainhead" which 
                    is a parody of Ayn Rand's book "The Fountainhead" 
                    modelled around an episode of the T.V. show "Friends". 
                    You can also find it on my homepage.
                </para>
            </footnote>
            and as I did, 
            I thought to myself how can a computer solve
            &fc;. I came to some conclusions and decided to test them by
            programming a working implementation. I first tried doing it in 
            Perl, but it turned out to be too slow. A C Program that I wrote
            later did the job well enough according to my standards.
            
        </para>

        <para> <!-- normal -->
            I packaged the software, wrote a README, put it on my Technion
            web-site and placed it on Freshmeat by labeling it simply as &fcs;
            version 0.2.0. 
            Since then, &fcs; saw more than twenty releases, each one adding 
            more features or improving speed, and has grown ten folds in its
            source base (more if you count the code needed to build and 
            maintain it). In this book, I'd like to tell you about some
            of the changes I incorporated in it, and what I learned in the 
            course of its development.            
        </para>

        <para>
            This book is about programming in general and C programming in 
            particular. I gained many insights by working on &fcs;, some
            of them related to programming game AIs; others relevant to 
            programming many other types of programs. This book is also
            about the dynamic of a small Open Source project. As you will
            see, many times, the input that I received from other users
            and developers affected the development of the program.
