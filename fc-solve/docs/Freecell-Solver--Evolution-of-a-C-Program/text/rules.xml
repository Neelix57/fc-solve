                Basic Rules of the &fc; Variant
            </title>

        <para>
            &fc; is played with a standard 52-card deck. At the beginning
            of play, all cards are dealt to 8 columns (7 cards each in the first
            four columns and 6 cards each in the other four) facing up.
        </para>

        <para>
            Besides the columns (which will also be referred to as stacks),
            there are also four places to hold temporary cards (known as
            freecells) and four foundations, in which it is possible to place
            cards of the same suit starting from Aces and ending with Kings.
        </para>

        <para>
            Sequences of cards on the tableau are built by placing cards on top
            of cards of a higher rank and of a different colour (black or red).
        </para>

        <para>
            An atomic move consists of any of the following:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>

                    Moving one card from the top of a column or from a
                    freecell to the foundation. (which is possible only if
                    its corresponding foundation's value is lower than it
                    by one)
                   </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Moving a card from the top of a column to a vacant freecell.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                    Moving a card from the top of a column or from a freecell
                    to a parent card on top of a column.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                    Moving a card from the top of a column or a freecell
                    to an empty column.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
            It is customary and helpful to group the movement of an entire
            sequence of cards, by moving intermediate cards to freecells or
            vacant columns. This will be refered to as a
            <glossterm>sequence move</glossterm>. If a sequence move involves
            temporarily moving a card to an empty column, it is known
            as a <glossterm>supermove</glossterm>.
        </para>

        <para>
            You should probably play a few games of &fc;, in case you
            did not already, because knowing the rules alone is not
            enough to have an intuitive feel of it. There are many available
            &fc; implementations for various systems, and you should have
            no problems finding one that you can use. (chances are that it
            is already installed on your system)

            Techniques of Play
        </title>
        <para>
            There are several strategies that become apparent after a large
            amount of playing &fc;. One of them, is uncovering top
            cards so a card can be moved to the foundations. Another one,
            is doing the same only to move it to a parent card, or for
            it to serve as the basis of another sequence.
        </para>

        <para>
            Another technique, that can be helpful at times is moving
            a card from the freecells back to the tableau, so it can serve
            as the base for another sequence.

            Variations on &fc;
        </title>
        <para>
            The game &fc; is not the only Solitaire of its kind nor
            is the first historically. Using &fc; as a basis, several
            similar Solitaire variants can be constructed by adjusting some
            of the basic rules:
            <!-- TODO: Modify emphasis to something more logical styled -->
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                    <emphasis>Sequence Parenthood</emphasis> - in some variants
                    cards can be placed on consequent cards of the same suit,
                    or of the cards of any suit whatsoever. Examples for this
                    are Baker's Game which is identical to &fc; except that
                    sequences are built by suit.

                    <para>
                    <emphasis>Policy of Filling Empty Columns</emphasis> - in
                    &fc; empty columns can be filled by any cards. In other
                    variants, such as Seahaven Towers or Forecell, only kings
                    may be placed there. On other variants, they cannot be
                    filled at all.
                    </para>
                </listitem>

                    <para>
                    <emphasis>Policy of Moving Sequences</emphasis> - in
                    &fc;, the amount of cards that can be moved as a
                    sequence is determined by the number of vacant Freecells
                    and columns present. In other variants such as Relaxed
                    &fc;, the amount of cards that can be moved as a
                    sequence is unlimited, regardless of how many vacant
                    resources exist on the board.

                    <emphasis>Variations in the number of Freecells, Columns
                        or Decks</emphasis> - Some &fc; variants are
                    played with two decks of cards. Many others varry on the
                    number of columns or freecells. &fc; itself is often
                    played with less than 4 freecells, in order to make the
                    game more challenging. (or vice versa)
                    </para>

        <para>
            Below you can find a table that summarized the essential properties
            of a large number of Solitaire games similar to &fc;. Their
            names were taken from <ulink url="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/pysol/">PySol</ulink>, which is a free Solitaire suite written in Python.

            <footnote id="pysol_variants">
                <para>
                Not all of these variants appear in PySol under the
                "FreeCell Type" category. As I noticed, many games were very
                similar to &fc; in their spirit, despite the fact that they
                were classified otherwise.
