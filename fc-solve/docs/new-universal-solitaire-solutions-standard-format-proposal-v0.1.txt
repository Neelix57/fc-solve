Abstract
--------

This is a proposal for a universal format for encoding solitaire solutions.
It grew out of a discussion on the fc-solve-discuss mailing list based on
some people's frustration with the so-called “standard notation” for
notating Freecell.

This standard is written in a pseudo-BNF / pseudo-C-struct format, which
will be format agnostic and can later be encoded in XML, JSON or a more
human-readable format (though conversions to this format will be explicitly
specified.).

Format:
-------

Rank = {Integer: from 1 to MAX_RANK } (MAX_RANK is normally 13 for French
playing card, but is specified at the header).

Suit = One Of{'H','C','D','S' }

Deck = {Integer: from 0 to NUM_DECKS - 1 }

Card = {
    Rank rank;
    Suit suit;
    Deck deck; # Optional
}
