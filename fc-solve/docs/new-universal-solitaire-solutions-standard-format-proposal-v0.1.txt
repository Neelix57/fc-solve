Abstract
--------

This is a proposal for a universal format for encoding solitaire solutions.
It grew out of a discussion on the fc-solve-discuss mailing list based on
some people's frustration with the so-called “standard notation” for
notating Freecell.

This standard is written in a pseudo-BNF / pseudo-C-struct format, which
will be encoding agnostic and can later be encoded in XML, JSON or a more
human-readable format (though conversions to these format will be explicitly
specified later.).

Format:
-------

Rank = {Integer: from 0 to MAX_RANK } (MAX_RANK is normally 13 for French
playing card, but is specified at the header).

Suit = One Of{'H','C','D','S' }

Deck = {Integer: from 0 to NUM_DECKS - 1 }

Card = {
    bool is_empty;
    bool is_hidden;
    Rank rank;
    Suit suit;
    Deck deck; # Optional
}

Column = {
    int len;
    Card cards[0 .. len-1];
}

Foundation_Id = { Deck deck, Suit suit }

Foundations = {
    Map : from Foundation_Id to Rank.
    # For all decks and suits
}

Freecells = {
    Array of NUM_FREECELLS cards that can be empty.
}

GamePosition = {
    Foundations foundations;
    Freecells freecells;

    Column x NUM_COLUMNS;
}

Column_Idx = {Integer: from 0 to NUM_COLUMNS-1 }
Freecell_Idx = {Integer: from 0 to NUM_FREECELLS-1 }

Source_Or_Dest_Id = union {
    Column_Idx col;
        OR
    Freecell_Idx freecell;
        OR
    Foundation_Id foundation;
}
