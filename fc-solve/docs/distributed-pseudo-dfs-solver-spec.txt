Distributed Pseudo-DFS Solver SPEC:
===================================

Description:
------------

The pseduo-DFS solver will traverse a board using a stack of states and their
derived states (while making sure derived states do not repeat after first
encountered.). The primary item of communication will be a
Coordinates-Sequence (CoordSeq) that is:

struct CoordSeq
{
    int64_t depth;
    int32_t coords[0 .. depth-1];
}

This is generated when traversing the board using a predefined preset (say
"-to 01ABCDE -sp r:tf") using pseudo-DFS with the assumption that the states
collection/lookup only holds the states that were discovered earlier in the
stack. (There's also a local (per-client) cache of previous dead-end states,
but they still do not prevent these states from appearing in the DFS-stack,
just immediately marked as a dead end.).
