Distributed Pseudo-DFS Solver SPEC:
===================================

Description:
------------

The pseduo-DFS solver will traverse a board using a stack of states and their
derived states (while making sure derived states do not repeat after first
encountered.). The primary item of communication will be a
Coordinates-Sequence (CoordSeq) that is:

struct CoordSeq
{
    int64_t depth;
    int32_t coords[0 .. depth-1];
}
