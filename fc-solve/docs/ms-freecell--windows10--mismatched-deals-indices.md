Apparently in recent versions of Microsoft Windows FreeCell on Windows 10, the
deal number display there is misleading for the "Random" deals which seems like
a bug in MS FreeCell. One can instruct it to deal a numbered deal or
alternatively input the cards' layout into the web-based solver manually using
the text notation.

We apologise for the inconvenience, but note that it is not our fault and it is
up to Mcrosoft to fix it.

We can recommend that you try PySol FC ( https://pysolfc.sourceforge.io/ )
which shares some maintainers with Freecell Solver, and which is FOSS (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ) and gratis and
should run fine on Windows and other platforms.
