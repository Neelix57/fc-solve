Hard Thread - a collection of soft threads, that should generally be placed
in one system thread. Hard thread contains resources that soft threads from
different hard threads would interfere with each other in allocating. Hard
Threads contain a collection of state packs, and various counters and other
variables.

Moves - A one-time displacements of cards from stacks to stacks, from stacks
to freecells, or from freecells to stacks. Also contain 
Soft Thread - a singular continuus scan operating on a states collection.
It can be Soft-DFS, DFS or Best First Search. There could be any number of
soft threads in a hard thread.

Packs - see State Packs

State Packs - An allocation of states. Each one is a buffer in memory, that
contain an array of packs. Each buffer remains at a constant memory location,
but more buffers are allocated as necessary. The implementation of State packs 
reside in the files fcs_isa.c and fcs_isa.h.

Stacks -
    1. Move Stacks (refer to them)
    2. Columns of the freecell games.
    3. The stacks used for maintaining the Soft-DFS recursion.
    4. The environment recursion stack.
