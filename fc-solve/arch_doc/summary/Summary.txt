Coding Conventions:
-------------------

1. Bottom Up Design and Evolution

2. Strict adherence to the ANSI C language
    - No gcc extensions
    - No C++
    - No C99

3. Strict adherence to the ANSI C Standrad Library
    - No dependency of glib, apr, and similar tools
    - Can optionally be compiled to make use of some binary trees and
        hash implementations
    - a lot of logic of them was implemented from scratch

4. Namespace purity
    - All global symbols lie in the freecell_solver_ namespace
    - Some macros are prefixed with fcs_
    - Usually freecell_solver_[class name]_function
    - Very verbose identifiers

5.
