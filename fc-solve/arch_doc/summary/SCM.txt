Game Presets Configuration:
---------------------------

The info for generating the game presets lie in the file gen_presets.pl. It
uses data structure inheritance to determine the exact parameters to be 
included in each preset. Its output should later be incorporated into presets.c

Maintaining a list of Modules:
------------------------------

The file gen_makefile.pl maintains a list of modules and headers across
all makefiles that are distributed as part of Freecell Solver. 

Generating the site:
--------------------

The site lies in the sub-directory of fc-solve/site/wml in the CVS and is 
generated using GNU Make, WebMetaLanguage and CVS glue. If a development
version is present, it is checked out of the CVS, packed into an archive,
and placed on the site with a link in the downloads page.

Both the vipe.technion.ac.il main site and BerliOS mirror are generated from
the same makefile and both are uploaded to their places using rsync.
