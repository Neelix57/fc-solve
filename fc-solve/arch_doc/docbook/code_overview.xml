        <para>
            &fcs; solves boards by using Depth-First Search or 
            Best-First-Search scans starting from the initial board. It has 
            a collection of the states, and constructs a tree of the 
            states descending from each state to its "parent". A parent state 
            means the state in which from which it was discovered.
        </para>

        <para>
            &fcs; can run several "tests" on each state. Each test generates
            a list of derived states. Some of the test are Freecell meta-move 
            ones, some are Freecell atomic move ones, and the others are 
            Simple Simon meta-move ones. The order of the tests can be 
            specified at the command line, and tests can be grouped, and 
            the order of checking of the tests within a group will be 
            determined by a special callback.
        </para>
        <para>
            To perform the scans themselves Freecell Solver distinguishes 
            between soft threads, hard threads and instances. An instance is 
            a collection of states and an initial board to explore. Each 
            instance may have several hard threads and each hard thread may 
            have several soft threads. A hard thread is something
            that would likely be put in a system thread. It contains such 
            resources, that a collision between them among several hard 
            threads running in parallel is undesirable. Nevertheless, 
            every hard thread can access the resources allocated by other 
            hard threads, should he encounter them in his scan.
        </para>
        <para>
            A soft thread is a singular scan. It performs a scan for a 
            certain number of iterations, at which point the hard thread 
            switches to a different soft thread.
