                        An extended state is canonized by its stacks being
                        uniquely sorted according to their contents, and an
                        array of indexes describing their original locations
                        sorted accordingly. This is done to make sure no two
                        states with the same permutation of states exist.

                        O(d) operations (where d is the depth) instead
                        of O(1) for Soft-DFS its use is deprecated. It was
                        the original scan supported by &fcs; 0.2.0 and
                        still exists in the code.

                        an initial board, a collection of states and all the
                        scans associated with it. An instance is initialized
                        whenever one wishes to solve new board. By using
                        command line parameters it is possible to configure it
                        to solve the board in many ways. Instance logic is
                        implemented in <filename>intrface.c</filename>, and 
                        the user API is implemented in 
                        <filename>lib.c</filename>. Users are advised to make 
                        use of the command line interface in 
                        <filename>cmd_line.c</filename>.
