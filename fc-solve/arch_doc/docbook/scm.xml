        <title>Game Presets Configuration</title>
        <para>
            The info for generating the game presets lie in the file <filename>gen_presets.pl</filename>. It
            uses <ulink url="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/51">data 
                structure inheritance</ulink> to determine the exact 
            parameters to be included in each preset. Its output should 
            later be incorporated into <filename>presets.c</filename>.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id="scm_maintaining_a_list_of_modules">
        <title>Maintaining a list of Modules</title>
        <para>
            The script <filename>gen_makefile.pl</filename> maintains a list 
            of modules and headers across all makefiles that are 
            distributed as part of Freecell Solver.
        </para>
        <para>
            Notice that the Win32 makefile is generated from a hard-coded
            template, while the other makefiles are read and modified by it.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="scm_generating_the_site">
        <title>Generating the Site</title>
        <para>
            The site lies in the <ulink url="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fc-solve/fc-solve/site/wml/">sub-directory of 
                fc-solve/site/wml in the CVS</ulink> and 
            is generated using GNU Make, WebMetaLanguage and CVS glue. If a 
            development version is present, it is checked out of the CVS, 
            packed into an archive, and placed on the site with a link in 
            the downloads page.
        </para>

        <para>
            Both the <ulink url="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/">vipe.technion.ac.il main site</ulink> and 
            the <ulink url="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">BerliOS mirror</ulink> 
            are generated from the same makefile and both are uploaded to 
            their places using rsync.
        </para>

        <para>
            The site generation process also generates a zip archive of the 
            latest stable version so it can be used to automatically 
            compile the Win32 binary.            
        </para>
    </section>

    <section id="scm_freecell_solver_config">
        <title>freecell-solver-config</title>
        <para>
            The autoconf process creates a freecell-solver-config program that
            can be used as an aid in programs wishing to compile and link
            against &fcs;. It is generated from freecell-solver-config.in by
            the configure script and is installed system-wide.            
        </para>
