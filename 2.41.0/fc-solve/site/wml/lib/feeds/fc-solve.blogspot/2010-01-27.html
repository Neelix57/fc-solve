<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.40.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.40.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This release contains a fix to a string overflow with processing the command 
line arguments, and an optimised command-line preset that can be invoked
as <tt>-l blue-yonder</tt> (or <tt>-l by</tt> for short) that solves the
Microsoft 32,000 deals in under 100 seconds on a Pentium 4 2.4GHz machine.
It also contains some more minor changes: there is now a <tt>Scan:</tt> header 
with the name of the current soft thread, when debugging under 
<tt>-s -i</tt>, an off-by-1 iterations count was fixed and the iteration
handling callback is now applied globally to all the instances. Finally,
<tt>make_pysol_freecell_board.py</tt> has support for generating PySol's
and PySolFC's 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_%28solitaire%29">"Black Hole"
    Solitaire</a> deals, intended for my newly released
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/">Black Hole Solitaire Solver</a>.
