<!-- TITLE=Freecell Solver 2.30.0 was Released-->
<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 2.30.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from 
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the 
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This release adds the run-time presets "gooey-unknown-thing", "sand-stone" 
and "slick-rock" that aim to minimise the average lengths of the resultant 
solutions. (as opposed to minimising the time it takes to solve). It also
adds support for using any of the tree imlpementation supplied by
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/avl/">libavl version 2</a> for
both the positions storage and the stacks storage.
</p>

<p>
There's a bug fix in the fc-pro range solver for a bug that caused the 
Freecell Pro compatible moves to be mis-calculated. Moreover, the code
has experienced a substantial re-organisation and the Makefiles for the
different compiler were merged into one (which was later fixed).
</p>

<p>
There are also new compile-time options to exclude various functionality
that may not be needed.
</p>

<p>
Download it while its hot!
