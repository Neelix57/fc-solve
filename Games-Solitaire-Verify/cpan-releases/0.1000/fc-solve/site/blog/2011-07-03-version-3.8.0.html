<p>
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> version 3.8.0
has been released. It is available in the form of a source tarball from
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/download.html">the
    download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
This release fixes some crashes using <tt>--trim-max-stored-states</tt>,
adds a more meaningful man page instead of the token one that was previously
present, adds <tt>scripts/parallel-range-solver-total</tt> to solve a range
of deals in parallel by splitting them into chunks, and many smaller
improvements and fixes.
</p>

<p>
We also forgot to mention the 3.6.0 release, which fixed the installation of
<tt>fcs_dllexport.h</tt>, added the <tt>--tracemem</tt> compile time option,
added a bug fix for incrementally increasing the iterations/stored-states
limits, added a built-in version of
<a href="http://www.kylheku.com/~kaz/kazlib.html">kazlib</a>'s balanced
binary search tree as a possible back-end for storage, and had some
other improvements.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!
